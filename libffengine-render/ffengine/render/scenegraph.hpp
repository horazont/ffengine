/**
 * A scenegraph node, from which all nodes in the scenegraph inherit.
 *
 * It provides three methods, advance(), render() and sync(), and introduces
 * the concept of GPU-only storage.
 *
 * The engine is made for rendering within QML and Qt Quick, which means that
 * we have to take care with threading. In QML, there are two main threads:
 * one for handling UI events and one for rendering using OpenGL. When a
 * frame starts, the threads synchronize, by blocking the UI thread and letting
 * the OpenGL thread prepare the frame. When the frame is prepared, the UI
 * thread gets unblocked and the OpenGL thread starts to render. Read more
 * about this in the [Qt 5 manual](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#threaded-render-loop).
 *
 * During the synchronization phase, sync() is called on all nodes. A node can
 * thus be sure that only the rendering thread is running while sync() is
 * called, and it has access to the OpenGL context.
 *
 * When the synchronization phase is over, render() is called on all nodes
 * which were in the scene graph at the point sync() was called (parent nodes
 * take care of separating them from changes which happen after sync()). When
 * render() is called, the UI thread may be running and thus no unguarded
 * access to shared data is allowed.
 *
 * To avoid bringing down performance, access to shared data should be avoided
 * altogehter. Instead, during sync(), data required for rendering should be
 * copied into local buffers or OpenGL buffers, depending on the type of data.
 *
 * For the sake of communication, let us call the state which is solely used
 * by render() "GPU-only data".
