Textures
--------

The waves00.png texture is sourced from the
[Tiled Directional Flow Water Shader](http://www.rug.nl/science-and-society/centre-for-information-technology/research/hpcv/publications/watershader/). Its
license is as follows:

                        This software is Creditware:

    you can do whatever you want with this shader except claiming rights
    you may sell it, but you cannot prevent others from selling it, giving it away
    or use it as they please.

    Having said that, it would be nice if you gave me some credit for it, when you
    use it.
