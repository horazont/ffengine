/**
 * Calculate the intersection point between a Ray and a triangle, the latter
 * given by three Vector3f.
 *
 * The implementation is a verbatim port of the implementation from
 * ["Fast, Minimum Storage Ray/Triangle Intersection" by MÃ¶ller and Trumbore](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/Courses/2003/ImageSynthesis/papers/Acceleration/Fast%20MinimumStorage%20RayTriangle%20Intersection.pdf),
 * using the two-sided triangle version.
 *
 * @param ray Ray to intersect the triangle with
 * @param p0 First point of the triangle
 * @param p1 Second point of the triangle
 * @param p2 Third point of the triangle
 * @return Tuple consisting of the "time" \a t at which the ray hits the
 * triangle and a boolean whether the ray hit the triangle.
